            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR great Misfortune in the Loſs of the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> hath made it abſolutely Neceſſary, that there ſhould be a further Proviſion for the Succeſſion to the Crown in the Proteſtant Line after Me and the Princeſs. The Happineſs of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Security of Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is Our chiefeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, ſeems ſo much to depend upon this, that I cannot Doubt but it will meet with a general Concurrence, and I earneſtly Recommend it to your early and effectual Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>The Death of the late King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Succeſſor to that Monarchy, has made ſo great an Alteration in the Affairs Abroad, That I muſt deſire you very maturely to Conſider their preſent State; and I make no Doubt but your Reſolutions thereupon will be ſuch, as ſhall be moſt conducing to the Intereſt and Safety of <hi>England,</hi> the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Peace of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are of ſuch Weight, that I have thought them moſt proper for the Conſideration of a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have the more immediate Senſe of the Kingdom in ſo great a Conjuncture.</p>

            <p>I am obliged further to Recommend to you, That you would Inſpect the Condition of the Fleet, and Conſider what Repairs or Augmentations may be requiſite for the Navy, which is the great Bulwark of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and ought moſt eſpecially in this Conjuncture to be put in a good Condition; and that you would alſo Conſider what is proper for the better Security of thoſe Places where the Ships are laid up in Winter.</p>
            <p>The Regulation and Improvement of Our Trade is of ſo Publick Concern, that I hope it will ever have your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thoughts; And if you can find proper Means of ſetting the Poor at work, you will eaſe your ſelves of a very great Burthen; And at the ſame time add ſo many uſeful Hands to be employed in Our Manufactures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick Occaſions.</p>
